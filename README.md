## Work of the members and Methodology

We decide to work together in our free time, with *DISCORD*, we make a big part of the project together, except for exemple the textual, the TXT, the README...

* All the projet was on Github, we worked on different branch for not making merging problem. 

![picture](images/branchGit.png)

* Firstly, we decided witch project we would done, we choosed Checkers because for us it was the one who could learn us the most things, and because we found this project more attractive than the other

* After that we started to create the board, and place pawns on it

* Next we started with the move of the White pawns, and Black pawns

* To continue we made the taking the pawns

* And After, The Queen/King

* With all of this we made the Textual, the Txt file, the Winning condition..

* For the bot we didn't got the time to make it, but at the beginning if you decide to fight him, you will get a "In development"

* That's all for the project, thanks to have read this, Have fun with the gameplay and Good luck vs your opponent !
